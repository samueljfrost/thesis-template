\section{How To Reference}
For you referencing I used Zotero to keep track of all of my citations. From Zotero you can then export your library as BibTeX into the parent directory of your thesis (in my case as references.bib). This is an example of a single citation \cite{frost_gecko-inspired_2016}. This is an example of multiple citations \cite{frost_gecko-inspired_2016,frost_micro_2016,frost_semitransparent_2018}. You can change the referencing style in the preamble in \textit{thesis-main.tex}.
